# surlyllabe
A syllabic highlighter for Word in French language. Developed in VBA Word, the macro analyses every word contained in the selection, calling a Python script to make their syllabation. Finally, it highlights each syllable with different colors, thanks to this analysis.
This project has been made-to-mesure for a French teacher in reading learning grade.
